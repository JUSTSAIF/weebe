# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/cairo/Cairo-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/cairo/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/cairo/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: ArefRuqaa
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/arefRuqaa/ArefRuqaa-Regular.ttf
    - family: Concert_One
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/ConcertOne-Regular.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Thin.ttf
